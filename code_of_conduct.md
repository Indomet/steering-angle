# Code of conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?

We plan to use gitlab as our main version control system where we will be dividing features and issues amongst ourselves, where each branch will be made to solve an issue or implement a given feature that the requirements specify. Moreover, we will divide the issues on a voluntary basis where the person thats most comfortable and confident would take up the issue

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

We plan to have a synced up workflow where everyone in the group is fully up to date on the state of the project, by regularly updating each other in physical and online informal "stand-up" meetings. Each group member MUST communicate on discord and not being proactive and responding will not be tolerated and will be brought up to the course responsible.
if a group member does not collaborate as asked of, it will be brought up to the course resposible as well.

## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

As mentioned previously we plan to have regular physical and online meetings at least twice a week, where we aim to discuss what was done and what needs to be done and share the knowledge and new skills we learn along the way. The meetings will start with a summary of what everyone has done and then proceed to what they plan to do in the upcoming week. The meetings will be around 30 minutes but it can be prolonged.

During the times where we will be having online meetings, we plan to always have the meeting in a voice call where we share our scren to show and explain what we have done. Thereby we foster an enviornment that promotes cross functional learning by showing and explaining what we have been working on.

If there are conflicts in time where one group member cannot join the meeting, there will be summary notes sent to the individual of the meeting. However regular skipping of the meetings is NOT allowed

## What is our usual communication plan?

We plan to regularly communciate via a private discord channel and have our online meetings within as well.

## How will we solve conflicts?

Group conflicts will be handled case by case where the entire team reviews the issue and evaluates the possible suggested solutions, then a majority vote will be held for fairness.

## How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?

All team members shall be skeptical by default for any output of any LLMs as
it may be hallucinating. Whenever an LLM is used inside of code there must be a comment indicating that the code was AI generated for transparency reasons.

### Our group policy for using LLM will allow for the following:
* Prompting ideas/tools to use
* Prompting code when one is not sure of the approach or syntax
* Copying generated code snippets (with careful review and understanding, rather than blindly copying)
* Generating code comments

### Ensuring transparency and traceability with the use of LLM:
* All usage of LLM must be indicated with a note to ensure transparency.
* All usage of LLM where generated code was used must additionally include citation to the LLM discussion.
* Generated code must be verified with external sources.
* The name and version of the LLM used must be included in each note.
* The entire conversations with LLMs shall be either saved as separate text files or as shared links if available.
